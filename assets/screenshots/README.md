# Placeholder Images

The following images should be added to complete the website:

## Screenshots (assets/screenshots/)
- main-menu.webp - Main menu screenshot from LiquidBounce
- clickgui.webp - ClickGUI interface screenshot
- hud.webp - HUD overlay screenshot  
- xray.webp - X-Ray functionality screenshot

## How to Add Real Images

1. Copy the actual screenshot images from the LiquidBounce folder
2. Convert to WebP format for better performance (optional)
3. Optimize file sizes while maintaining quality
4. Replace these placeholder references in the HTML

The website is designed to gracefully handle missing images with error handling in the JavaScript.
